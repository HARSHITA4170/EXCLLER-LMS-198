            "\n",
            "\n",
            "**1. WIDAL Test:** This test checks for antibodies against *Salmonella Typhi* and *Salmonella Paratyphi*, bacteria that cause typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever.  The numbers (e.g., 1:160) represent the dilution of the sample at which antibodies were still detectable.  Higher numbers generally suggest a greater likelihood of infection.  In Mr. Goud's case:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **S. Typhi \"O\" 1:160:**  Suggests a possible past or present infection with *Salmonella Typhi*.\n",

            "* **S. Paratyphi \"AH\" 1:20:**  Within the normal range, suggesting no current infection with *Salmonella Paratyphi* AH.\n",
            "* **S. Paratyphi \"BH\" 1:20:** Within the normal range, suggesting no current infection with *Salmonella Paratyphi* BH.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Important Note:** The Widal test can give false positives or negatives, and further tests would usually be needed to confirm a typhoid diagnosis.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "**2. Dengue Serology:**  This tests for dengue fever, a viral infection spread by mosquitoes.  All three tests (NS1 antigen, IgG, and IgM) were negative, meaning no evidence of current or recent dengue infection was found.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "**3. Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR):** This measures how quickly red blood cells settle at the bottom of a test tube. A higher ESR can indicate inflammation in the body. Mr. Goud's ESR is elevated (26 mm/hr in the first hour, 52 mm/hr in the second), which suggests the presence of inflammation.  Further investigation is needed to determine the cause.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "* **Hemoglobin (Hb):**  13.6 g/dL (within the normal range).  This measures the amount of oxygen-carrying protein in the blood.\n",
            "* **Red Blood Cells (RBC):** 4.3 million/cu mm (slightly low, but within the acceptable range). These cells carry oxygen.\n",
            "* **White Blood Cells (WBC):** 7,200 cells/cu mm (within the normal range). These cells fight infection.\n",
            "* **Platelet Count:** 2.0 lakhs/cu mm (within the normal range). These cells help with blood clotting.\n",
            "* **Packed Cell Volume (PCV):** 40.5% (within the normal range). This is the percentage of red blood cells in the blood.\n",
            "* **Differential Count:** This breaks down the types of white blood cells. All are within normal limits.\n",
            "* **Peripheral Blood Smear:** A microscopic examination of the blood; results indicate normal red blood cells, white blood cells within normal limits, and adequate platelets.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "**6. HbA1c:** This test measures average blood sugar levels over the past 2-3 months. Mr. Goud's level (5.4%) is within the normal range for someone without diabetes.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "\n",
            "**8. Random Blood Glucose:** This measures blood sugar at a single point in time.  Mr. Goud's level is within the normal range.\n",

            "* **Total Bilirubin, Direct Bilirubin, Indirect Bilirubin:** All within normal limits, indicating no liver damage or blockage.\n",

            "* **Total Protein, Albumin, Globulin, A/G Ratio:** All within normal ranges.\n",
